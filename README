bindings sit on top of PyQt6 and are implemented as two separate modules
corresponding to the different libraries that make up the framework.

The documentation for the latest release can be found
`here <https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt6/>`__.


Installation
------------

The GPL version of PyQt6-QtWebKit can be installed from PyPI::

    pip install PyQt6-QtWebKit

``pip`` will also build and install the bindings from the sdist package but
Qt's ``qmake`` tool must be on ``PATH``.

The ``sip-install`` tool will also install the bindings from the sdist package
but will allow you to configure many aspects of the installation.


Building From Source
--------------------

```
sip-build --jobs 30 --pep484-pyi --verbose --qmake=/usr/lib/qt6/bin/qmake6 --qmake-setting "QT += printsupport"
```
